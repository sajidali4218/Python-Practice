1. Chennai Super Kings (CSK): Players bought by CSK are as follows:

Rachin Ravindra (Rs. 1.8 crore)
Shardul Thakur (Rs. 4 crore)
Daryl Mitchell (Rs. 14 crore)
Sameer Rizvi (Rs. 8.4 crore)
Mustafizur Rahman (Rs. 2 crore)
Avinash Rao Aravelly (Rs. 20 lakh)
Worst Buy: Mustafizur Rahman, because the overseas slots will be filled by Devon Conway, Daryll Mitchell, Mahesh Theekshana and Matheesha Pathirana and spinners dominate at Chepaux, and with addition of Rachin Ravindra, 'The Fizz' is unlikely to feature.
2. Mumbai Indians: Players bought by MI are as follows:

Gerald Coetzee (Rs 5 crore)
Nuwan Thushara (Rs 4.8 crore) 
Dilshan Madushanka (Rs 4.6 crore) 
Mohammad Nabi (Rs 1.5 crore)
Shreyas Gopal (Rs 20 lakh) 
Anshul Kamboj (Rs 20 lakh) 
Naman Dhir (Rs 20 lakh) 
Shivalik Sharma (Rs 20 lakh)
Worst buy: Mohammad Nabi, because the all-rounder requirement is already filled by Hardik Pandya and Tilak Verma, and also, Gerald Coetzee and Dilshan Madhushanka will be the prime bowlers for MI as overseas players, the presence of Afghanistani all-rounder is highly unlikely. 

3. Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR): Players bought by KKR are as follows:

Mitchell Starc (Rs 24.75 crore)
Mujeeb Rahman (Rs 2 crore)
Sherfane Rutherford (Rs 1.5 crore)
Gus Atkinson (Rs 1 crore)
Manish Pandey (Rs 50 lakh)
K.S. Bharat (Rs 50 lakh)
Chetan Sakariya (Rs 50 lakh)
Angkrish Raghuvanshi (Rs 20 lakh)
Ramandeep Singh (Rs 20 lakh)
Sakib Hussain (Rs 20 lakh)
Worst Buy: Gus Atkinson, because the overseas slots will be filled by the irreplacable players in Mitchell Starc, Jason Roy, Andre Russell/Sherfane Rutherford, and the fourth slot will be between Sunil Narine and Mujeeb ul Rahman, given the nature of spin friendly tracks at Eden Gardens.
